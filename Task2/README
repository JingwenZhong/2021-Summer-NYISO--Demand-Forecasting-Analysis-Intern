### First individual project

This task focused on the Solar generation data analysis and forecasting modeling for different zones.
The goal of this project is to be able to predict zonal solar generation values using a wide array of weather observation data sets
and satellite irradiance information.
The motivation of the project is that as more people use BTM solar systems, changes in solar energy generation will cause discrepancies between 
actual energy generation and expected energy generation. Such discrepancies may lead to an imbalance in the grid causing energy shortages and surpluses.
The shortages and surpluses are costly for utility companies as they may result in dispatching emergency energy from other companies or wasting energy. 
It is important to conduct accurate solar generation forecasts of BTM solar generation and make informed grid balancing decisions to minimize costs and operations complexity. 
Besides, solar generation is a very sensitive to other factors such as weather. 
We can use a forecasting model to make a long-term forecast of solar power generation using predicted future climate changes.
