Projects focused on: BTM Solar generation forecasting and analysis

The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), a non-profit organization, is at the heart of New York State’s electric system, operating the high-voltage transmission network, administering and monitoring the wholesale electricity markets, and planning for the state’s energy future. The NYISO is responsible for the reliable operation of New York’s nearly 11,000 miles of high-voltage transmission and the dispatch of over 500 electric power generators. In addition, the NYISO administers bulk power markets that trade an average of $7.5 billion in electricity and related products annually.

I have done my summer internship at the NYISO under System & Resource Planning department’s Demand Forecasting & Analysis team for duration of 12 weeks in summer 2021. 

I was needed to carry research on Solar Generation Analysis and forecasting using python, I conducted a large amount of data cleansing, data visualization, forecasting models, and statistical analysis based on the results.
